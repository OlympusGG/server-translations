Our server supports multilanguages, but since we don't have native speakers of each country playing our server, we will need your help to get the most accurate translations !

## How to

We are working with Pull Requests. If you want to participate and you don't know how to do it, feel free to read those articles which explains it :

[First contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)

[First contributions Desktop Tutorial](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/github-desktop-tutorial.md)

### Game Rules

+ All non-translated keys will fallback to EN.
+ You also need to provide the modified file **as-is** without **any extensions modifications** or **renames**.
+ Every special character, especially line-breaks (\n) and tabulations (\t) must be respected and shouldn't be deleted.
+ If the keys has parameters (player's name, amount...) use [string.Format documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.format?view=netframework-4.8#inserting-a-string) and do not hesitate to ask for help if needed
+ Only **values** of keys must be modified.
+ I'll change the keys if needed.

Thanks in advance, \
NosWings Team.
